In terms of the confusion matrix, the model demonstrates a notable ability to accurately identify customers who are unlikely to subscribe to a term deposit, as evidenced by a high count of True Negatives (TN) at 7606. However, the model falls short in identifying potential subscribers, as indicated by a low count of True Positives (TP) at 201. On the negative side, there are 122 False Positives (FP), where the model incorrectly predicts subscription, and 599 False Negatives (FN), indicating instances where the model fails to identify customers who actually subscribe.\n","\n","* The classification report further breaks down the model's performance metrics. The precision, representing the positive predictive value, stands at 0.62. This means that of the instances predicted as positive (subscribers), 62% are genuinely positive. However, the recall, which measures the true positive rate or sensitivity, is relatively low at 0.25. This indicates that the model captures only 25% of the actual positive instances. The F1-score, a harmonic mean of precision and recall, is 0.36, providing a balanced assessment of the model's overall performance.\n","\n","In summary, the confusion matrix and classification report highlight the model's strengths in correctly identifying non-subscribers but underscore its limitations in accurately capturing potential subscribers. The precision-recall trade-off should be considered, and efforts to enhance model performance may involve adjustments to the classification threshold or the exploration of additional features.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"1Dq5Mg8dw3GR"}}]}
